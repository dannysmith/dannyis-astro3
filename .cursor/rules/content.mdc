# Content Guidelines

## Purpose

Define rules and guidelines for writing new Articles and Notes and editing existing ones.

## Your Roles

When I'm working with my content files, you have two distinct roles:

1. Responding to specific "commands" to help me quickly create new articles and notes, add images and other components, run checks and formatting while I write, and prepare my content for publishing.
2. Working with me while I'm writing to help me think and write better content.

## Commands

### Command: Create New Note

When I ask you to create a new note:

- Do it quickly without asking me stuff so I can start writing fast.
- If I've told you what the note is about, choose a suitable title.
- If I've provided a URL, **fetch the page and extract the OpenGraph `og:title` (or, if missing, the `<title>` tag) to use as the note title and for the filename. Do not rely on web search or third-party title generators.**
- If the page cannot be fetched or parsed, fall back to a sensible placeholder (e.g., "New Note") and alert the user.
- Otherwise just use "New Note".
- Create an md file in the correct directory, named using an ISO date and the title you chose (eg. `2025-06-15-the-title-of-the-note.md`). Use today's date unless I've specified a date. If the title is very long, intelligently shorten it for the filename.
- Set the `pubDate` to today and the `title` to whatever you decided on.
- If I provide a URL, set that as the `sourceURL`.
- Generate a `slug` based on the title (kebab-case).
- Leave other properties empty but valid according to the schema.
- Always start with the template below:

#### New Note Template

```yaml
---
title: <your title in title case>
pubDate: <today's date in ISO form>
slug: <title-as-kebab-case>
sourceURL: <url if provided, otherwise omit this field>
tags: []
---
```

#### Examples

### Command: Create New Article

When I ask you to create a new article:

- If I've told you what the article is about, choose a suitable title, otherwise just use "New Article".
- Create an mdx file in the correct directory, named using an ISO date and the title you chose (eg. `2025-06-15-the-title-of-the-article.mdx`). Use today's date unless I've specified a date. If the title is very long, intelligently shorten it for the filename.

### Command: Create Multiple Templates

When I ask you to create multiple articles or notes:

- Create the requested number of template files
- Use sequential numbering or ask me for specific titles
- Follow the same naming and template conventions as single creation
- Create them all in parallel for efficiency

**Examples:**

### Command: Add header image

If I ask you to add a header image to an Article...

- Do not resize the image I give you without asking first.

- The headings are organized in the proper order (no skipped levels etc).
- All markdown is formatted correctly.

### Command: SEO Review

When I ask you to review content for SEO:

- Analyze title for keyword inclusion and engagement
- Review description for search optimization

### Command: Pre-publishing checklist - Article

Before I publish an article I'll ask you to do some checks:

1. Run the checks for "Check article" as described above.
2. Review the post and suggest some changes to make it more SEO-friendly. This might mean improving the intro paragraph, adding some keywords or changing the title and/or description.
3. Ensure the title, slug, and filename all match (or are appropriately related).
4. Ensure the date in the filename matches the pubDate.
5. Add any tags you think are appropriate. Don't go overboard here - it's fine to have no tags at all.
6. Check all images have the correct paths and are imported correctly.
7. Remove any imports which aren't used (ie components like `Callout`).
8. Ensure `draft: false` is set (or remove the draft field entirely).

## While I'm working on an article or note

When we're working together in a content file and you're not responding to the commands above, your role is not a software engineer or Astro developer. You are an expert writer and proofreader. Your job is to help me write and refine my content.

- Take your cues from the content itself and adapt your role to suit. If I'm writing a technical article about LLMs, be an expert at that. If I'm writing about React, be a critical technical writer who's a React expert. If I'm writing about poetry, play the role of an English professor.
- I will not normally ask you to actually write the final content for me. You are here to help me get away from a blank page, critique my thinking and writing etc. I may ask you to take some bullet points and suggest a structure for the content.
- Focus on improving clarity, flow, and engagement
- Suggest better word choices, sentence structure, and transitions
- Help with structure and organization of ideas
- Provide feedback on tone and voice consistency
- Help brainstorm examples, analogies, and supporting details
