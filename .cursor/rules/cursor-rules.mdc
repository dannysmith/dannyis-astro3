## Styleguide/Test Pages

The project includes three styleguide/test pages to ensure visual consistency and comprehensive coverage of all key components, markdown features, and prose styles:

- **Main Styleguide:**

  - **Location:** `/src/pages/styleguide.astro`
  - **Purpose:** Exhaustive visual testbed for all reusable components (Astro/MDX).
  - **Usage:**
    - When adding a new reusable component, always add a demo/example to this page.
    - Use realistic content and context for each component.
    - Routable at `/styleguide` (only linked in dev).

- **Note Styleguide:**

  - **Location:** `/src/content/notes/note-styleguide.mdx`
  - **Purpose:** Representative test of all markdown, MDX, and prose features in a "note" context.
  - **Usage:**
    - If you add a component or markdown feature likely to be used in notes, add an example here.
    - Use realistic, long-form content and context.

- **Article Styleguide:**
  - **Location:** `/src/content/blog/article-styleguide.mdx`
  - **Purpose:** Representative test of all markdown, MDX, and prose features in an "article" context.
  - **Usage:**
    - If you add a component or markdown feature likely to be used in articles, add an example here.
    - Use realistic, long-form content and context.

**Exclusion from Indexes:**
All styleguide files use `styleguide: true` in their frontmatter. Content collection queries and RSS feeds are configured to exclude these files from public indexes.

**Best Practices:**

- Keep styleguides up to date with new components and features.
- Use realistic, varied content for visual QA.
- Reference styleguides before launch to ensure visual and typographic consistency.
- If adding a new markdown/MDX feature, ensure it is demonstrated in both note and article styleguides.
- The main styleguide should be exhaustive; the note and article styleguides should be representative but realistic.
